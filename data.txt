i have a lizard
lizards are reptiles
i own a bearded dragon
i like computer science
my neighbor walked my small dog
i have a big house
my family lives in a house near the beach of new jersey
i have many friends
my best friend is a cat
a cat is an animal
a dog is a man's best friend
miles are units of measurement
the kid lives ten miles from the supermarket
the boy will go to the supermarket
my friend is going for a swim
my group of friends went on an adventure
she will eat dinner at a restaurant
i am playing my guitar by the campfire
there exists a variety of instruments
a trumpet is an example of an instrument
a troll lives under the bridge deep in the forest through the trees
my car is a machine
this red car is a complex machine with an hot engine
people like fast cars
she will try this expensive car
they will try speaking without thinking
his face was red from their words
that man across the road quietly went for a swim early in the morning
